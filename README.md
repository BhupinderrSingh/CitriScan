🍊 CitriScan: AI-Powered Citrus Disease Detection
CitriScan is a Deep Learning project designed to support sustainable agriculture by identifying diseases in citrus leaves with high precision. This project was developed as part of my 6th-semester B.Tech studies and presented at the AI Impact Summit 2026.

🛠️ Features
Deep Learning Model: Built using TensorFlow/Keras for multi-class leaf disease classification.

Interactive UI: A user-friendly web interface powered by Gradio for real-time predictions.

Sustainable Impact: Aims to reduce crop loss by providing early and accessible diagnostic tools for farmers.

📁 Repository Contents
citriscanleave.ipynb: The full research notebook including data preprocessing, folder splitting, and model training.

app.py: The deployment script for the Gradio web interface.

🚀 How to Run
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/BhupinderrSingh/CitriScan.git

Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

Launch the app: python src/app.py

🔮 Future Roadmap
Blockchain Integration: Developing a "Digital Passport" using Solidity to log health certifications for agricultural exports.
